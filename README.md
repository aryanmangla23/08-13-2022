Been busy for last 5 days just working on college apps nothing interesting.

Not emotional, just feeling normal. Feels weird to feel normal after going through a rollercoaster for a majority of the year.

Went to library at 10 after my dad spent an hour switching his mind whether I drive or he drops me off. At the end, I took the car. Priscilla got me boba cuz she and her lil bruda lost to me in piano tiles. now he is playing the game nonstop and grinding waiting to get revenge on men. no cap on a stack homie sheesh.

Studied for like 4 hours then while going out the library with priscilla to chipotle, we saw claire. havent seen her in 3 months. nice to talk to her :DDDD. Lol, she was completely clueless last 3 months. she was astonished xD. she was looking at me like, and i was like k why u lookin at me ðŸ¤¨. we know why she was lookin at me. but i told her later dat idrc. lmfao she thought i had beef with priscilla cuz we were sitting in diff spots, but in reality we just wanted to actually get work done. xDDD. 

Kay said goodbye to her then went to chipotle with priscilla. ðŸ˜‹. Dropped at library then went to joseph to hang out with soohyuk and claire again. Literally just fooled around for an 1.5 hours then went to westgate cuz claire needed supplies and da bois went to random shops and took funny photos. roleplaying as customers looking for blazers. Will add photos later. We trolled for another 10 minutes at westgate and made claire late LOL. so she had to cancel and just go home. i wish that these kids didnt fool around so much to the point u ruin someone's plans, but since these other 2 were so into pissing her off that i just stayed with them. The drive back was rough. Mad claire is another breed. Somewat scary, but at the end when i pointd out she laughed. So ya she stillchill and everything. Bcak to jojo/syoon's house. claire left. hanged out with those 2 morons and just went through each other's photos from summer. 

Left at 6:15 and reached home at 6:29. Did absolute no work after reaching home, but it's fine. I was hella productive earlier so it's aite. Now here we are writing my diary :D. Actually feels weird to be normal and not feel anything bad. I mean i felt good today fs cuz fun day, but usually it is feeling waste and sad. Hopefully no more sad days till 2nd sem.
